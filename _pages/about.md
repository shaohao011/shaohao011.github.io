<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I'm now a PhD student at <a href='https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/'>Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a>, <a href='https://www.shlab.org.cn/'>Shanghai AI Laboratory</a> and Shanghai Innovation Institute, advised by Prof. Xiaosong Wang.

I am dedicated to exploring the applications of artificial intelligence in the medical domain, with a primary focus on computer vision, multi-modal large language models, and reasoning-related topics.

[BrainMVP: Multi-modal Vision Pre-training for Medical Image Analysis](https://github.com/shaohao011/BrainMVP)[CVPR2025 Highlight]

***Shaohao Rui***, Lingzhi Chen, Zhenyu Tang, Lilong Wang, Mianxin Liu, Shaoting Zhang, Xiaosong Wang

<span> We introduce the first multi-modal vision pre-training method (BrainMVP) for missing modality medical data. We demonstrate the superior performance and the enhanced generalizability of our BrainMVP pre-trained models on ten public segmentation and classification
benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art methods.</span>
